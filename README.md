## 🎯 1. Core Problem: Emotion vs Finance

Most financial losses in emerging markets happen during **cognitive vulnerability** — panic, stress, distraction.  
Traditional FinTech only checks account validity, **not rationality of the mind**.  

- ❌ **Threat:** Emotional scams, impulsive high-interest loans, market panic  
- 💡 **Solution Thesis:** Protect users from their own emotional state

## 💡 2. The Emotional Checkpoint

**NeuroFinance** is the first **neuro-emotional AI assistant** that monitors the user in real-time, enforcing friction to prevent impulsive financial loss.  

### Fusion AI Engine: Emotional Confidence Score (ECS)

| Factor | Input | Weight | Function |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| Emotional Risk | Facial cues (Stress ↑, Anxiety ↑) | 50% | Core vulnerability measurement |
| Cognitive Risk | Typing speed ↑, Error rate ↑ | 30% | Measures distraction & impulsivity |
| Behavioral Risk | New recipient, Large amount, Off-hours | 20% | Flags unusual or risky behavior |

**Trigger:** ECS < 50% → transaction intercepted 🚨
