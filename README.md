🎯 1. The Core Problem: Emotional Loss
Most Africans face financial setbacks not from ignorance, but from moments of cognitive or emotional vulnerability. Stressed users make impulsive payments, trust scams, or over-leverage debt.
 * ❌ Emotional Scams: Phishing messages exploiting urgency (e.g., "urgent family issue, send money").
 * ❌ Impulsive Investing: Panic-buying or panic-selling during market volatility.
 * ❌ Payday Loans: Decisions made under extreme anxiety or stress.
The Gap: No existing FinTech platform understands the user's emotional state before approving a transaction.
💡 2. The Solution: Emotional Checkpoint
NeuroFinance is an emotional AI assistant that calculates a user's risk in real-time, enforcing a moment of necessary friction to restore rational decision-making.
The Fusion AI Engine
We combine three distinct, weighted vectors to calculate the Emotional Confidence Score (ECS):
| Factor | Input Data (Simulated) | Weight | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Emotional Risk | Facial Cues (Stress, Anxiety) | 50% (High) | Core vulnerability detection. |
| 2. Cognitive Risk | Typing Speed, Error Rate | 30% (Medium) | Measures distraction and impulsivity. |
| 3. Behavioral Risk | Transaction Context (New Recipient, Large Amount, Time of Day) | 20% (Low) | Flagging unusual patterns. |
The Intervention Flow (Demo Scene)
 * Detection: Fusion AI processes inputs (e.g., high stress, fast typing) \to ECS drops below 50\% (RED ZONE).
 * Intervention: User clicks 'Send Money.' The app triggers the Emotional Checkpoint modal.
 * Resolution: A short countdown (5s) forces a pause. The UI encourages calming, and the AI simulates stabilization \to ECS is restored, transaction is safely approved.
⚙️ 3. Technical & Innovation Highlights
This project stands out by integrating complex analytical models with critical real-world impact.
Advanced Technical Features
| Feature | Implementation | Hackathon Advantage |
|---|---|---|
| Feature Transparency | D3.js Radar Chart | Visually demonstrates which factor (Emotional, Cognitive, or Behavioral) is driving the risk score in real-time. |
| Live Monitoring | D3.js Line Chart | Simulates continuous ECS tracking, showing the effectiveness of the intervention live on screen. |
| Privacy Principle | On-Device ML (Simulated) | Design priority: All emotional data processing logic is intended to run locally (TensorFlow Lite), ensuring AES-256 privacy. |
🌍 Impact and Scalability
 * Cybersecurity Layer: Offers unique protection against emotional social engineering scams.
 * Scalability: Designed to integrate via API with major African mobile money platforms (MTN, Flutterwave).
 * Gamification: Users earn NeuroBadges and cash-back rewards for successfully averting impulsive high-risk actions.
🏆 Presentation Pitch (2-Minute Script)
> "In Africa, millions lose money every year, not from ignorance, but emotion. When stressed or anxious, we make impulsive payments, trust scams, or overspend. NeuroFinance changes that. Using AI to read your emotion through your face, tone, and typing, it detects when you’re vulnerable—and gently stops risky transactions. It’s not just smart finance—it’s emotionally intelligent finance. With on-device processing and encryption, your data never leaves your phone. NeuroFinance—where your brain meets your budget."
