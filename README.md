üß† NeuroFinance: Your Brain Meets Your Budget
Project Status: üèÜ Hackathon Submission Ready
üéØ The Core Problem
In Africa, millions lose money annually, not due to lack of financial literacy, but due to emotion-driven impulse. Panic-selling, accepting predatory payday loans while stressed, or falling victim to emotional phishing scams ("Your relative is sick, send money!") are common vectors for financial loss.
The Gap: No existing FinTech application monitors the user's emotional or cognitive state to prevent impulsive, high-risk actions.
üí° The Solution: Emotional AI Checkpoint
NeuroFinance is the first neuro-emotional AI assistant designed to detect and intercept financial vulnerability in real-time.
It leverages a Fusion AI Model to calculate a user's Emotional Confidence Score (ECS). If the score drops into the RED ZONE (Critical Risk), it triggers an Emotional Checkpoint‚Äîa mandatory, short delay that allows the user's prefrontal cortex to regain control before a final, high-stakes decision is made.
üåü Key Innovations & Technical Wins
| Area | Feature | Why It's Advanced |
|---|---|---|
| AI Core | Fusion Model & Transparency | Combines three distinct risk vectors (Emotional, Cognitive, Behavioral) and uses a live Radar Chart to show which factor is driving the intervention. |
| Intervention | Emotional Checkpoint | A unique behavioral finance safeguard that stops the transaction, forces a pause, and monitors stabilization before approval. |
| Cybersecurity | Cognitive Hacking Defense | Acts as a defense layer against emotional phishing and social engineering by validating the user's state, not just their credentials. |
| Aesthetics | Cyber-Neon UI | Visually stunning, high-contrast dashboard with D3.js real-time graphing for an immediate "wow" factor. |
| Impact | NeuroBadge | Gamifies self-control by rewarding users (e.g., with small cashback) for successfully averting impulsive actions. |
‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture
The application is built for maximum speed and data privacy.
| Layer | Technology | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend/Demo | HTML5, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript | Responsive, high-impact Cyber-Neon UI running in Colab. |
| Data Visualization | D3.js | Used for the real-time ECS Line Chart and the Feature Importance Radar Chart (demonstrates factor weighting). |
| AI Model | NumPy / JavaScript Fusion Logic | A lightweight, probabilistic model that combines and weights multiple inputs into the single ECS metric. |
| Security Principle | On-Device ML Simulation | All sensitive 'emotional data' processing is designed to occur locally (simulated in JS) to ensure data never leaves the user's device. |

üëâ NeuroFinance Interactive Dashboard
Demo Walkthrough (What to Show)
 * Initial State: Show the dashboard running with Calm & Focused input (ECS \approx 90\%).
 * Simulation: Select Critical Panic & Impulsive from the dropdown. The ECS drops immediately to the RED ZONE (e.g., 34\%). The Radar Chart instantly shows Emotional Risk as the dominant factor.
 * Intervention: Click Attempt GHS 1,500 Transaction.
 * Checkpoint: The red, shaking modal appears with the 5-second countdown.
 * Resolution: After the countdown, the user state reverts to Calm, the ECS jumps back up, and the Impulsive Actions Saved metric is incremented.
üåç African Context & Future Scope
 * Targeting Phishing: Directly addresses prevalent emotional phishing scams that exploit familial urgency.
 * Partnership Ready: Designed for B2B integration with Mobile Money operators (MTN, M-Pesa) and local banks.
 * Future Vision: Deploy the model via TensorFlow Lite on mobile to use actual camera/typing data for real-world impact.
üìû Team Roles
 * AI/ML Lead (You): Fusion Model Development, Core Logic, D3.js Visualization.
 * Frontend Dev: UI/UX Design (Cyber-Neon Theme), HTML/CSS Structure.
